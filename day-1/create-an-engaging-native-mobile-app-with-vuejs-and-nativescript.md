# Create an Engaging Native Mobile App with Vue and NativeScript by Jen Looper

March 27th, 2018

## Talk

### NativeScript is...

*   It is a framework for building native ross-platofrm mobile apps
*   No compromise, smoothly animating native mobile apps for iOS and Android
*   NativeScript is ultimately JavaScript. You use JS, CSS, XML to build your app
*   You could still use your favorite tools like Sass, TypeScript, etc.

### Why Vue?

*   Vue's 2.0 adoption of the virtual DOM enables native mobile rendering
*   Vue offers a great way for web developers to embrace mobile platforms via NativeScript or Weex
*   Vue is lightweight so highly appropriate for mobile
*   NativeScript and Vue have code-sharing potential

### How Does NativeScript Work with Vue?

*   3 Basic Differences
    *   You import Vue from 'native-script-vue'
    *   Bootstrapping the app is different in NativeScript vs web
    *   Layout is a little different as well

### Try It

*   Try http://play.nativescript.org
*   There is a Vue-CLI template as well `nativescript-vue/vue-cli-template`

### Case Study: Elocute

*   For web, used...
    *   Vue CLI
    *   Vuetify
    *   Firebase UI for Authentication
    *   Vuex for state management
    *   Firebase backend
*   For mobile, used...
    *   NativeScript CLI
    *   Webpack template
    *   NativeScript-Vue Plugin
    *   Vuex for state management
    *   Firebase backend

### In the Future

*   Real code sharing
*   The notion of building for iOS, Android and Web in one repo
*   Keeps two separate templates (one for web and one for mobile) within the same SFC

## Presentation Notes

*   \+ Live demo with the phone was good to demo the performance
