March 28th, 2018

## Talk

### Living Styleguide

*   Code implementation of your design system that helps to redue code duplication and save you time during development
*   The key here is Reusable Components

### What is Storybook?

*   The UI development environment that you'll love to use
*   Stories show up in Storybook
*   Different use case for your component?
    *   Just create a new story and pass in new props
*   It is FAST

### Demo

*   It gives you a playground to see things update before they decide to use it

### Storybook Driven Development

*   Think TDD with your eyes. Or as Peter would like to say, "visual unit testing"
*   If you like TDD though, wy not both? You can do both apparently!
*   Sharing code has never been easier. no more reinventing the wheel

### Ecosystem

*   This is perhaps the best feature about ecosystem
*   Some he recommends includes:
    *   Storybook-info: displays usage or other types of docs alongside your story
    *   Storybook-knobs: Create adjustable toggles and knobs for props
    *   Storybook-jest: Bring Jest results into your Storybook
    *   StoryShots - Automatic Snapshot Testing for Storybook
