## Talk

### VS Code

*   Cross-platform, lightweight editor by Microsoft
    *   Smart Editing
    *   Fast
    *   Extensible
    *   No. 1 active repo on GitHub
    *   Responsive devs

### Vetur

*   Vue tooling for VS Code
    *   2.2M
    *   1.7k stars on GitHub
    *   Recommended Vue extension for VS Code or TypeScript
    *   #1 extension when sorted by rating on Extension Marketplace
*   Features
    *   Syntax highlighting
    *   Snippet
    *   Emmet
    *   Linting / Error checking
    *   Formatting
    *   Auto Completion
    *   Hover Info
*   Future features
    *   Type validation within the template
*   To be honest...
    *   Better than others, but
    *   Missing some LSP features, and existing ones could be improved
    *   Sass/Jade
    *   Mixin support
    *   Thinks it's 60% complete. We'll get there though
    *   Can we get it to 120%?

### Status Quo Prototyping

*   Problem with online prototyping
    *   Little language support
    *   Crowded space
    *   No Vim can't use
    *   Where's my snippet / themes
    *   No shortcut
    *   Slow
*   Problem with local prototyping
    *   Still slow
    *   Hit save
    *   Wait for Webpack to comile
    *   Wait for the magical white flash
*   In vue-cli-3.0, there is vue-serve which works pretty well
*   What if I can offer you something better?
