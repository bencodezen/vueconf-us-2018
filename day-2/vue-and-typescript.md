## Talk

### What is TypeScript?

*   It is JavaScript with Static Types

### Why Types?

*   You care about types because it determines the behavior you have at runtime
*   Static Types are meant to catch undesirable behavior
*   Types can assist in providing better tooling / dev experience (i.e., autocomplete, hints, etc.)
*   Type checking can already help with finding errors before even compiling
*   **(!) You don't have to do much to get the benefits of typing**

### TypeScript and Vue

*   It was fairly complicated to get it set up
*   However, things seem to be better now
*   TypeScript 2.8 was announced yesterday (3.27)

### What does it take to get it working?

*   Once 3.0 comes out, you can just configure it during the cli setup
*   Use an up to date version of TypeScript and Vue
*   Use --strict-er TypeScript settings
*   Use Vetur for editing .vue files
*   Use Vue.extend with the object API
*   Annotate computed methods
