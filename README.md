## Day 2 - Conference

### Opening Keynote by Evan You

Opening Keynote by the creator of Vue.js, Evan You!

### Deciphering You by Gregg Pollack

It’s one thing to understand how to use a framework, and quite another to understand how it works beneath the surface. In this talk we’ll take a deep dive under the covers to begin to understand how Evan You (and the core team) put it all together.

### How We Do Vue At GitLab by Jacob Schatz

Based on a few of [our articles](https://about.gitlab.com/2017/11/09/gitlab-vue-one-year-later/). We talk about what we've learned in 1 year of using Vue in production. How we mix in Vuex, webpack, and other tools. How we write tons of code and get from idea to production so quickly using VueJS as our workhorse. How we get crap done at GitLab.

### Vue in Motion by Rachel Nabors

Learning a JavaScript framework can look intimidating if you come from a traditional design background. But Vue has some of the best features for designing with motion. Come see how to translate your motion design into Vue-powered prototypes!

### Testing Vue Apps by Edd Yerburgh

In this talk I'll explain how to structure a test suite, and how to write effective unit tests for Vue components.

### Lightning Talks - Day 1

Get involved with VueConf.US! This is your chance to do a 8 minute presentation on your favorite Vue.js (or other) topic!

### Serverless Functions and Vue.js by Sarah Drasner

Serverless is the most clickbaity title for an actually interesting thing. Despite the name, Serverless does not mean you’re not using a server, rather, the promise of Serverless is to no longer have to babysit a server. Scaling is done for you, you’re billed only for what you use. In this session, we’ll cover some key use cases for these functions within a Vue.js application: we’ll accept payments with stripe, we’ll gather geolocation data from Google Maps, and more! We’ll make it all work with Vue and Nuxt seamlessly, simplifying how to leverage this paradigm to be a workhorse for your application.

### vue-rx by John Lindquist

Vue.js ships with a built-in reactive system to help easily manage data and state throughout your app, but RxJS streams allow you to control complex async situations through streams. This lecture will cover how Vue.js integrates with RxJS and walks through the common problems taking this approach can solve.

### Create an Engaging Native Mobile App with Vue and NativeScript by Jen Looper

You have a beautiful web site built with Vue? Great! Now you need a mobile app to engage your users even further. Or, better yet, you need to offer different, yet complimentary functionality, while retaining shared code between your web site and mobile app. Welcome to the beautiful world of Vue and NativeScript, which, paired together on the web and on mobile, make for a great user experience.

### Vue Core Team Panel

Meet the Vue.js Core Team and ask them your questions!

## Day 3 - Conference

### 7 Secret Patterns Vue Consultants Don't Want You to Know by Chris Fritz

As a Vue consultant and member of the core team, Chris will share some of the lesser-known features and patterns you can use to improve your apps and amaze your colleagues.

### Agile Design Systems in Vue by Miriam Suzanne

Style Guides & Pattern Libraries are great tools for documenting the relationships between code and UX, but beautiful docs are only half the battle. We don’t all have dedicated teams and budgets to build a centralized system. How can we build patterns into our code, using Vue components and pre-processors to iterate and automate living design systems in an agile and integrated process?

### Vue & TypeScript: Up and Running by Daniel Rosenwasser

One of TypeScript's goals is to make sure that JavaScript users of all communities can use the language. Over the last year, the TypeScript team has put effort in to making TypeScript & Vue work together much more seamlessly. Come find out a bit about that work, and how you can benefit from TypeScript today!

### A React Point of Vue by Divya Sasidharan

At a glance, React and Vue are like two peas in a pod. They are lightweight component-based libraries for building user interfaces and can be used fairly interchangeably to build scalable web applications. Though they are noticeably different in terms of syntax, their key differences lie in their respective ways of thinking. As a React developer learning Vue, adapting to the “Vue way of doing things” is a challenge that requires a sound understanding of the philosophy behind Vue. In this talk, we will examine the nuances between the two frameworks and cover common mistakes that React developers make when switching from React to Vue.

### Lightning Talks - Day 2

Get involved with VueConf.US! This is your chance to do a 8 minute presentation on your favorite Vue.js (or other) topic!

### Vue & SSR: The Best Practices by Sebastien Chopin

Writing an Universal Application with Vue might be hard, this talk will show common problems with server-side rendering and how to deal with them. It will also show how Nuxt.js solves most of these problems for you.

### A Short Synopsis of Vue Storybook by Peter Finn

Building and documenting a component library at your company can be a huge hassle, but is a great way to keep your code consistent and clean among all of your projects. Storybook and Vue take most of the pain out of this, and allow you to develop a set of core components and document them in no time!

### Prototyping with Vue Single File Component by Pine Wu

With a compact templating syntax and rich support for major web languages, Vue Single File Component is ideal for sketching out UI components, animation, interaction prototypes and data visualization. In this talk, I present a mini Vue SFC based framework that prescribes setup, languages and coding styles in exchange for the best prototyping experience.
